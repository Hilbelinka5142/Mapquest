# Mapquest

  Some of the baglog features that I have said should be implemented are adding in a better user interface, making it easier to read the instructions after putting in your route.
  
As well as adding in a feature to maybe allow the program to track your current location so that yo uare able to just tell it where you want to go instead of having to also type in where you
are starting from.

  When looking at the objecttives fro these features is just to make the user experience better and easier. making it so that when the user wants to use this program it is easier for them to understand the instructions that they are getting as well as just having an easier use with not having to put in the information of the starting location.
  
  When I was using this program throug the lab I thought it was really nice and easy but still a little hard to see all the information that I was giving me, as well as being a little annoying to have to type in my location everytime. And so with having someone that is less inclinded with computers than I am it would be a lot harder to use this program.
  
  When we are looking at the new code that was added into the program to help with getting the users current location it is the function of "Get_current_location" in the number 7 code file. I will also link a screenshot of that here. ![image](https://github.com/Hilbelinka5142/Mapquest/assets/144185910/f3b4225a-745d-41ab-942c-348d423141ce)
  
  With creating this program on a machine first I needed to add everything in so I was able to just create everything on my computer and then push everything through into GitHub here is a screenshot to show the best I was able to deminstrate the changes. ![image](https://github.com/Hilbelinka5142/Mapquest/assets/144185910/c4e96757-6703-4723-9bdb-dfabe74a15d0)
  
  The test cases that I used because of the few changes I only used a couple but they were, starting with just making sure the API key works and was valid.  Then leading to making sure that they API was getting the correct location as well as being able to identify between different IP addresses. As well as just seeing what works and doesn't work with having an user use the program. And making sure that it knows that to do when there is an error.
  
  Having the pipeline is really helpful because this can help with putting stuff and implementions into place without really have to worry about having errors, mostly with human errors.  As well as just being able to work on the project making it easier to implement everything and have everything checked over to make sure that it was working.
  
  Some things that were challenges with this activity was just figuring out the new code that we were putting into the program and making sure that it worked for the most part.  This I just had to look up a lot of information on the API as well as trying to implement the code to make sure that it works. another thing is that just making and testing the code was a challenges, most with just time and patience with sitting and waiting and testing one thing after another.  But overall I have learned the importence of testing as well as just some new knowledge with coding.
