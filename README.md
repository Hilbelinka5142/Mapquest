# Mapquest

  Some of the baglog features that I have said should be implemented are adding in a better user interface, making it easier to read the instructions after putting in your route.
As well as adding in a feature to maybe allow the program to track your current location so that yo uare able to just tell it where you want to go instead of having to also type in where you
are starting from.
  When looking at the objecttives fro these features is just to make the user experience better and easier. making it so that when the user wants to use this program it is easier for them to understand the 
instructions that they are getting as well as just having an easier use with not having to put in the information of the starting location.
  


  
- Specific objectives for these selected features.
- Rationale behind the choice of these features.
- Showcase the application code with the new features.
- Demonstrate the changes pushed to GitHub.
- Provide details of the test cases utilized.
- Explain the functionality of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Reflect on challenges encountered during this activity, how you addressed them, and the lessons learned.
